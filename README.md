# LBW-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning system for predicting LBW (Leg Before Wicket) events in cricket matches. The system uses ball-by-ball match data (e.g., bowler speed, spin, trajectory, batter stance, pitch location) to predict whether a delivery will result in an LBW.  It is designed for cricket analysts,  and support decision-making.
